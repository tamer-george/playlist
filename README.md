      - Add  Songs to it
      - Play the playlist and enjoy the songs :)
      - Move to next song
      - Back to previous song
      - Search for a specific song if available
      - Delete a song for the playList
      - Exit the programm

      - Classes
      - Modules 
      - Instance variable
